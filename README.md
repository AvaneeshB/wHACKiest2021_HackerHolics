<h2>Venders helped by the NGO</h2>
<h2>Problem statement: - HACKING POST COVID PROBLEMS</h2>
<h4>Idea: -  Due to Covid-19 , many small scale enterprises and vendors who earn and eat on daily basis lost their earnings and hence need a support to grow again. We as developers will provide a platform connecting regional NGO's who ll buy and sell the basic stuffs eliminating the large scale enterprises and providing livelihood to both vendors and consumers</h4>
